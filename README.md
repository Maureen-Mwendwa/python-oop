# Python OOP Assignment

This repository contains the implementation of a Python class named `Person` as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment.

## Assignment Requirements

1. Create a Python class named `Person`.
2. The `Person` class should have the following attributes:
    - `name`: representing the person's name.
    - `age`: representing the person's age.
    - `gender`: representing the person's gender.
3. Implement a method called `introduce` that prints a message introducing the person with their name, age, and gender.
4. Create an instance of the `Person` class and call the `introduce` method to display the person's information.

## Implementation

The `Person` class is defined in the `person.py` file. Here's how you can run the code:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Maureen-Mwendwa/python-oop.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd python-oop
3. Run the `person.py` file: python person.py
4. This will create an instance of the `Person` class with the name "Maureen Mwendwa", age 23, and gender "Female", and then call the `introduce` method to display the person's information.

## Example Output
Hello, my name is Maureen Mwendwa and I am a female aged 23

**Feel free to modify the `person.py` file to create additional instances of the `Person` class or extend the functionality as desired.**
